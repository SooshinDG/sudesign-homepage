## Project Overview

This is the homepage for **수디자인 (SooDesign)**, an interior design company. The project is being built with Claude Code.

## Status

The project is in its initial stage. No framework or build tooling has been set up yet. As the stack is established, update this file with:

- Build commands (`npm run build`, `next build`, etc.)
- Dev server command (`npm run dev`, etc.)
- Lint/format commands
- Test commands and how to run a single test

## Notes

- The primary language for this project is Korean (한국어); UI text and comments may be in Korean.
- Once a framework is chosen (e.g., Next.js, Astro, plain HTML/CSS), document it here along with relevant conventions.
